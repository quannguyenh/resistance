# resistance

Dependences:
matrix-toolkits-java

Description:
The code is to provide several utilities:
- compute spectral values of graph edges
- sort edges based on their resistance value
- perform three types of graph sampling.
Random edge is a sampling method in which edges are chosen at randome.
DSS and SSS are sampling methods which choosing edges based on their resistance values.
